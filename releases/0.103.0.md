## grimoire-elk 0.103.0 - (2022-07-11)

**New features:**

 * Entry points to support enriching plugin mechanism\
   This plugin mechanism allows ELK to use third-party enriching
   backends. Developers only need to include the next snippet in their
   package configuration and ELK will import them as any other core
   backend.  ``` entry_points={"grimoire_elk": "mybackend =
   package.subpackage:get_connectors"}, ``` **NOTE**: In the previous
   example, `get_connectors` is a function that returns the backend
   classes needed to enrich a datasource. Take the next snipped as an
   example: ``` def get_connectors():     return {"backend": [MyBackend,
   MyBackendOcean, MyBackendEnrich, MyBackendCommand]} ```
